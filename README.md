# BokuLoader - Cobalt Strike Reflective Loader
Cobalt Strike User-Defined Reflective Loader written in Assembly & C for advanced evasion capabilities.

### Project Contributors: [Bobby Cooke @0xBoku](https://twitter.com/0xBoku) & [Santiago Pecin @s4ntiago_p](https://twitter.com/s4ntiago_p)

## Features
+ Direct NT Syscalls via HellsGate & HalosGate
+ NOHEADERCOPY - Loader will not copy headers over to beacon. Decommits the first memory page which would normally hold the headers
+ NoRWX - The Reflective loader writes beacon with Read & Write permissions and after resolving Beacons Import Table & Relocations, changes the .TEXT code section of Beacon to Read & Execute permissions 
+ XGetProcAddress for resolving symbols
+ 100k UDRL Size
+ Caesar Cipher for string obfuscation

# Project Origins
+ Based on Stephen Fewer's incredible Reflective Loader project: 
  + https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection
+ Initially created while working through Renz0h's Reflective DLL videos from the [Sektor7 Malware Developer Intermediate (MDI) Course](https://institute.sektor7.net/courses/rto-maldev-intermediate/) 

## Usage
1. Start your Cobalt Strike Team Server with or without a profile.
2. Unless you only generate RAW payloads, set the stagesize to 412256 in `build_arsenal_kit.sh` located in the Arsenal Kit. Note that recently this kit contains the Artifact Kit.

3. Load the `dist-template/artifact.cna` Aggressor script.

4. Go to your Cobalt Strike GUI and import the BokuLoader.cna Aggressor script.

5. Generate your x64 payload (Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S))
  + Does not support x86 option. The x86 bin is the original Reflective Loader object file.

6. Use the Script Console to make sure that the beacon created successfully with this User-Defined Reflective Loader
  + If successful, the output in the Script Console will look like this:

## Build
1. Run the `make` command after installling required dependencies
```bash
# Install brew on macOS if you need it (https://brew.sh/)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# Install Ming using Brew
brew install mingw-w64
# Clone this Reflective DLL project from this github repo
git clone https://github.com/boku7/BokuLoader.git
# Compile the BokuLoader Object file
cd BokuLoader/
make
```
2. Follow "Usage" instructions

+ Reenz0h from @SEKTOR7net
  + Most of the C techniques I use are from Reenz0h's awesome courses and blogs 
  + Best classes for malware development out there.
  + Creator of the halos gate technique. His work was the motivation for this work.

### HellsGate Syscaller
+ @smelly__vx & @am0nsec ( Creators/Publishers of the Hells Gate technique )
  + Could not have made my implementation of HellsGate without them :)
  + Awesome work on this method, really enjoyed working through it myself. Thank you!
